Rick Carlisle: if rick carlisle was still alive he would be furious¬†

Doc Rivers: dame and giannis getting injured ended the doc rivers hate
Doc Rivers: yk if doc wins this game this going to be his 2008 celtics part two
Doc Rivers: i think brook gets cooked in this drop coverage in the 3rd and doc has to go back to a zone.

Doc Rivers: guess we are going to find out tonight if glenn rivers can coach or not..
Doc Rivers: and doc can‚Äôt take him out because there‚Äôs no one else to give his minutes to
Doc Rivers: how many years is doc rivers signed for?
Rick Carlisle: hey this is a sorta cool thing rick carlisle and the pacers
Doc Rivers: i know doc rivers gets a lot of well deserved crap, but if there's something he's proven time and time again is that he's great at doing a lot with a little. the guy is a personified choke but when the expectations are low his teams rise.

Doc Rivers: doc rivers, you are now a guangdong tiger!

Doc Rivers: at least doc finally learned to play ajax

Doc Rivers: bucks fans are annoying af please stop crying, admit it doc and dame won‚Äôt work, accept this no more championship and sleep tight
Doc Rivers: brain dead folks on here still gonna be yapping about doc rivers still
