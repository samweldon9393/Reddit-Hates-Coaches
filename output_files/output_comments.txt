‚Äòshoot a three‚Äô

someone get this kid on the coaches bench, i‚Äôve heard enough to know we‚Äôve got a spoelstra-esque strategist in the stands.
you give doc less tools to work with and he performs better.
that kid yelling about threes all game is a prime example of stephen wardell curry‚Äôs demonic influence on america‚Äôs youth
a 3pt game at half against the midwaukee back(up)s?

if rick carlisle was still alive he would be furious¬†
god, i still fully expect the pacers to pull away with a signature run at some point in the 3rd, but if the bucks somehow steal this one, it would be the most doc thing ever.
ok doc might actually have an excuse this year jesus christ
undermanned doc rivers is the best coach of all time...
doc rivers new formula for the future is just beat your best players with a hammer and lull the opponent into a false sense of security
tbh i‚Äôm more excited to watch this game now, was expecting to lose without giannis and dame but now at least doc has to play the young guys
no talent doc doing voodoo and shit to keep the wisconsin herd in this game lol
with both giannis and dame out, i have my money on the bucks since doc is the coach
smart call for carlisle to push hali and turner away from the refs telling hali to stop complaining. the refs clearly are happy to throw out techs tonight, no need to get on their bad side with so much game to go.
the bucks are going to have to start the equipment manager that doc threw under the bus at this rate
who the fuck voted for jason kidd for coty lmfao
‚Äúwe‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù

‚Äúwe have to play hoosiers basketball‚Äù

doc rivers, everyone.
i remember someone in the mke sub last night said we should just bench middleton in case he gets hurt, to preserve trade value (if any) and got laughed out of the thread..

rip to that dude
doc rivers without half his rotation is the greatest coach of all time
it¬¥s a disgrace this is happening because of injuries, and i actually like the wide majority of the bucks roster... though it¬¥s always cool to shit on doc rivers losing as a coach üëç
maybe doc should have used some of these guys earlier.
why is doc always yelling at ajax üòÇ
maybe the plan has always been to get doc and then make the roster worse so he could coach them up
the blake griffin
exasperated doc face never gets old
damn doc can barely walk
bucks are gonna run it back with doc next year aren't they
man i root for the bucks in other games because i root for midwest teams but holy shit the fans in this thread are so salty. wtf are the pacers supposed to do? lose on purpose?
is doc about to cook with an undermanned team again lmao?
lol doc doesn‚Äôt even care
the worse players doc has the better he is
rick carlisle vs doc porn hub rivers
 doc might actually be top fifteen all time if he clutches this somehow lmao
giannis and dame getting hurt is a gift from the basketball gods for doc rivers. now he has the perfect excuse
this isn‚Äôt his fault but fire doc rivers
bucks really went down when doc had ajax out for too long just saying
middleton is being held up by duct tape and super glue and this game is still within reach.
carlisle using this game to get hali's groove back, siakam is being played so much more passively
ultimate doc redemption, comeback from ,3-1
myles is killing you doc do something
i clowned the hire but i think doc has coached well this series.
lopez looks like he's gonna pop a gasket
doc rivers is the most reliable coach in the league you know how his teams going to finish year in year out
doc rivers asked for mercy. myles turner granted him none!
pacers better pull everyone of value. thanasis is about to go full bowling ball for the next 60 seconds. ü§£
i just want to say i love the midwest and i hope you do too much love to both teams
i just think the indiana concession stand employees are more locked in and that‚Äôs why doc likely loses this game
yall are so obsessed with doc rivers it blows my mind.
that doc rivers angry walk is hilarious for some reason
middleton, lopez hell even pat bev could also be injured and we‚Äôd still be trolling doc rivers for losing again. he has no escape.
how the fuck has spo never won one
doc boutta pull a spo and shock the world
refs saved doc from making a 0-0 challenge
gregg anthony sounds like he‚Äôs on a drip of melatonin 24/7
undermanned doc team.  fell for the trap card
you know who would have had a talk with his team to ensure they don't do shit like this?

a good coach.

the milwaukee bucks on paper have all the reasons to lose, but it all stems from them hiring glen rivers
then again it is an undermanned doc team
‚Äúwe gotta play hoosiers basketball‚Äù - doc rivers
why doesn‚Äôt doc use his secret weapon in thanasis? he can‚Äôt be any worse then some of these other guys
dame and giannis getting injured ended the doc rivers hate
yk if doc wins this game this going to be his 2008 celtics part two
i think brook gets cooked in this drop coverage in the 3rd and doc has to go back to a zone.
rick carlisle may have not gotten enough sleep. seems like the only game plan he could think of is ‚Äúshoot threes‚Äù.
i just wanna see doc cry, please
man, i forgot how good carlisle is
[angry doc waddle intensifies]
can doc break the curse?
the bucks will win this game. doc loves overperforning with bench guys
gallinari had no prop bets tonight he was so buried on the bench. doc dug up his corpse and it has 6 pts tonight.¬†
the refs are just trying to help khris. they refuse to let doc kill him
so coach bud won the bucks a title and got the number one seed last year. only to replace him with adrian griffin and then fire him when he was doing well and hire doc rivers who has a losing record in games he‚Äôs coached. now they‚Äôre on the cusp of going down 3-1 in the first round.
pat bev and crowder is a deadly combo, doc cooking
this should have been a competitive series but the only people who have a net positive from this...

mike budenholzer and adrian griffin.

both these guys will be a great pick up (correction) bud for a team with a star and adrian for a young team.
no answers for lopez. if i was doc i would just run lopez low posts over and over until it stops working.
another year another erik spoelstra snub
jason kidd. michael malone. what
how does this impact doc river‚Äôs legacy?
don't worry bucks fans, doc will come up with a plan
fucking up doc game plan prolly helps the bucks really
who do i root for if i like the bucks but also want further evidence that doc is overrated
underdog doc rivers is just next level when it comes to coaching
give doc a bunch of scrappy players and no expectations and he‚Äôs coach of the year.
wow even carlisle had to tell him to calm down lmao
did doc already use up his "criticize the training staff" card?
even doc is shook
a rick carlisle team being this ass defensively needs to be studied
rick carlisle runs a good offense
if carlisle had another ring he'd get the reputation he deserves
what could've been if they just kept adrian griffin
doc rivers isnt going to be liked by bucks fans
doc rivers knows so much about blowing 3-1 leads maybe that will help his team overcome one.
doc turns into spo when he doesn‚Äôt have any stars. if i‚Äôm the wizards i know who i‚Äôm hiring.
bobby is one of the lowest emotional iq players in the league. you have to know better
honestly one of the only playoff series where doc can‚Äôt be blamed for losing
i feel sorry for doc rivers. like genuinely.
who the fuck voted for bickerstaff?
i want milwaukee to lose the series so rdcworld1 drops a banger on doc rivers again.
doc rivers and his shiny noggin need to go back to tv
announcer is clueless, we‚Äôre already down mathurin, traded buddy and bruce, nembhard being out would be devastating for us.
mcdermott has no reason to be on the floor rn. carlisle runs the rotation too deep sometimes
would have been easier to see if middleton was in the restricted area or not if doc rivers didn‚Äôt take up half of my screen when the play happened
guess we are going to find out tonight if glenn rivers can coach or not..
bright spot for bucks is their rook is playing pretty damn good

and doc can‚Äôt take him out because there‚Äôs no one else to give his minutes to
how many years is doc rivers signed for?
hey this is a sorta cool thing rick carlisle and the pacers
i know doc rivers gets a lot of well deserved crap, but if there's something he's proven time and time again is that he's great at doing a lot with a little. the guy is a personified choke but when the expectations are low his teams rise.
trucker ted cruz sitting behind carlisle
blake griffin type throw in dunk
i feel like doc would be a good college coach
bruh carlisle help haliburton up lol. just walked by him
the bucks have the opportunity to do the funniest thing with doc next week
looking like rick carlisle, jalen brunson and kristaps will be making second round of playoffs‚Ä¶
damn. as much as i enjoy watching doc lose, i already know he‚Äôll get a pass on this one lol.
you think doc will be back?
doc rivers, you are now a guangdong tiger!
i'm not convinced by the pacers even with the bucks being undermanned.  if doc is ever going to reverse the narrative and come back from being down 3-1, this is the series where it could actually happen.
anya taylor joy is such a babe
ar this point, doc might have to lace em up
if we have winners and losers for the season, bud has top be very up top as a winner after this clusterfuck season in the bucks. he kind of secured a good job
milwaukee did coach bud dirty
indiana looking so good this year is why people need to stop calling monty the worst coach of all time and give him time

when carlisle took over the pacers were trash, but they worked with him to bring in the kind of players he wanted and let him build the kind of team he wants

didn't get impatient and fire him just becuase the pacers were terrible in his first 2 years
bucks fan you will be ok you got doc rivers still
doc rivers about to lose with another championship caliber team lmao
bucks are stuck with doc and this aging roster for a couple more seasons. things aren't going to get better.
midwest mid off
carlisle‚Äôs rotations make no sense
awesome charge khris
the downfall of doc rivers‚Äô teams truly need to be studied
bucks fans are sooo mad lmao this thread is awesome¬†
i know bucks are undermanned but it‚Äôs still hilarious seeing doc rivers standing over there. how did they think that was the answer? can i interest you in monty williams next?
after 2 decades of horrific luck including two all nba players suffering career altering injuries and then forcing their way out, the pacers are finally in the drivers seat of a playoff series‚Ä¶ and people hate it? mad because haliburton smiles? this shit is mental illness lmfao.
at least doc finally learned to play ajax
carlisle tripping playing mcdermott
i dont think thats his hair i think he shaved his dog and glued it into a mohawk
doc rivers has the fakest hair ever
poor doc rivers. i seriously feel for this dude.
galaxy brain move by doc here. he can't choke a lead in the series if his team is not leading
will doc be back next year?
i think the bucks were gonna collapse anyways, so the injuries have led to doc somehow being saved once again going into next year.

‚Äúman, if only our guys were healthy.‚Äù
every injury just makes it even more likely doc rivers returns next season
carlisle not having won a playoff series since 2011 and escaping much of any online criticism is remarkable
ok so doc plays marjon and he scores the second his hand touches the ball. why has he been dnp‚Äôd all this time?
congrats tyrese you hit a 3 against the hospital bucks pop off
beyond obviously not getting to watch good players and good basketball, the worst part of the giannis and dame injuries is we were robbed of seeing if doc would choke again
refs are utter nonsense. like that continuation call made zero sense. and greg anthony agreed with it, he's such a terrible commentator - vanilla and adds nothing of value.
adrian griffin must sipping champagne somewhere seeing this.
bucks fans are annoying af please stop crying, admit it doc and dame won‚Äôt work, accept this no more championship and sleep tight
brain dead folks on here still gonna be yapping about doc rivers still
