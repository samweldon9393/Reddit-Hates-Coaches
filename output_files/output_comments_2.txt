jason kidd is a great playoff coach
just glad we aren't playing against westbrook and dort trying to injure our players.
your stars cant suck ass in the western conference finals, awful performance
no one holds kidd to 0-6 in game 1s
well now i look like a dumbass for thinking kidd was losing game 1s on purpose as a 5d chess move
the wolves came out looking tired, i wouldn’t take too much from this game. that was the lowest energy even at the start that ive seen from them in a long time
it's crazy the mentality kyrie brings to this team. whenever they're down it never feels like they're flustered. him and kidd have them so calm and collected. everytime the wolves took a shot the mavs came back. 

i'm thinking ant is regretting calling kyrie out. he really looked gassed at the end. 

i don't think the series is even close to over though. this is gonna be a fun one for unbiased nba fans just trying to watch an exciting series. it's going long.
when kidd decided that it’s nice to win a game 1 for a change.
that game was awesome. can’t wait for the rest of the series!
"steal the home court advantage"

old red head billy burr gonna go crazy on thursday
kyrie about to get his second ring.

his ring will be much valued by the so-called “basketball community”, compared to kd’s rings.😂😂😂😂😂😂
jason kidd has beaten the can’t win game one allegations.
whoever wins the east might win it all because the west has been a bloodbath 
anthony edwards once again played like shit just like he did in game 7 vs the nuggets, and his team won game 7 and they still could have won this game

i need y'all to stop saying that man has no help, he was dog water tonight for his team, kat was the one keeping them in it

wolves like the pacers choked down the stretch, they kept making bad plays and terrible choices, finch having kye anderson inbound the ball so luka didn't even bother to guard him because he can't shoot forcing minnesota to waste their last time out, their star player "mjs son" didn't show up and their coach was outcoached by jason kidd lmao
i don’t like svg. bring back j-crawford. the rapport between him and reggie is awesome
