Gregg Popovich:
i see his face, the video on nba tv, espn.........it just doesn't feel real. 

he was 41. 

i always used to think anything post 30 was old, but damn it isn't. its hit me, that is still super young. 

i just feel...........empty, shocked. 

i saw him in moesha.....he was supposed to continue to get old, be an old head who would appear on tv from time to time. 

for me, my basketball watching started with hakeem/mj/ewing/robinson/kemp/stockton then the duncan/kobe/shaq era then lbj then curry...........

i mean, kobe defined that post mj/prelbj era.........a big part of my youth's pop culture, sports fan life.........gone. 

idk......this feels weird. prince, bowie - they were all old....it felt sad, but not a shock.........this is, my heart hurts. the culture took a blow today.

Steve Kerr:
bomani jones had the best take of everyone. he was like "yo! why are you mad at lebron? he didnt do anything wrong. beyond being two faced, and do you want to know the only person in the media who called him two faced before, me! remember when lebron wore those eric garner i cant breathe shirt? well, during that time another black teen was murdered in cleveland. he was shot while playing with a toy gun in a park but lebron said nothing. because it wasnt easy to say. kerr and lebron and all these semi left wing people are not taking risks criticzing trump. it may seem like it but the dude has a 57 percent disapproval rating right now. that's a common opinion. lebron will never say something inflammatory. he's just not that cat" i paraphrased the fuck out of that but yeah.

Steve Kerr:
it was interesting when trump called out steve kerr for not standing up to china when steve kerr has zero fear blasting trump.

it was a good point but trump didn't bother to follow it up with a diss of china. trump didn't say the thing he was bashing kerr for being afraid to say.

point is: i'm not seeing max kellerman follow this up by putting out how awful china is...

Steve Kerr:
its not just that lebron didnt take a stand, its that he went out of hsi way to criticize the person who did take a stand.   if he had stayed neutral like kerr i think most reasonable people wouldnt have really had an issue with him, although it would still be disappointing.
